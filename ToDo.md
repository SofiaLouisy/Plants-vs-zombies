# To do

## Prio
* Jag måste lösa hur listorna med lanes hanteras. Om sista plantan i lanen dör, vad händer då? Hur ska None hanteras, och var ska det hanteras?



* Finish the game (game over/victory)
* Add an attack projectile class that has movement/position and that will attack the zombie when "is blocked"
* A plant can create an attack projectile object when a zombie is on the lane
* Add a pointer that points on the plant in the front of
the lane (so it is clear who to compare "is blocked" to)
* Customize grid so that it fits the board
* Organisera AdventureGames via lanes, sedan zombie/plant.
* Use insertion sort to sort zombies, to know who to be attacked by plant
