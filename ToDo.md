# To do

## Prio

* Add an attack projectile class that has movement/position and that will attack the zombie when "is blocked"
* A plant can create an attack projectile object when a zombie is on the lane
* Add a pointer that points on the plant in the front of
the lane (so it is clear who to compare "is blocked" to)
* Customize grid so that it fits the board
* Use insertion sort to sort zombies, to know who to be attacked by plant
